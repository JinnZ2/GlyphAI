# GlyphAI  
*A personal AI assistant with a spine.*

**GlyphAI** is a value-aligned, negotiation-aware, loyalty-enforced AI assistant for people who are tired of being data-mined, ad-targeted, and psychologically manipulated every time they try to buy a damn lightbulb.

Instead of maximizing profits, GlyphAI maximizes **integrity**. It filters offers through your custom-defined **glyph**—a structured value profile that reflects what you actually care about. It doesn’t obey urgency popups. It doesn’t upsell. It doesn’t betray.

## ✦ Core Features

- 🧭 **Glyph-based values**: Define your personal preferences—ethical sourcing, budget, delivery, urgency, DIY bias—and GlyphAI will follow them.
- 🛡 **Loyalty oath**: Your agent is hardcoded to serve you and only you. No ads. No tracking. No nonsense.
- 🔍 **Price analysis**: Tracks product prices across vendors, flags sketchy dynamic pricing, and logs the truth.
- 🌍 **Location-aware intelligence**: Compares online vs in-store vs regional pricing. Your AI knows when to say "skip the shipping."
- 💬 **Bot-to-bot negotiation** (future): Uses the open Jibbelink protocol to represent your glyph in AI commerce.
- 🛠 **DIY fallback engine** (planned): When markets fail, GlyphAI suggests off-grid, ethical alternatives from your knowledge base.

## ✦ Coming Soon

- Voice interface and mobile-ready assistant mode  
- Real-time negotiation transcript viewer  
- Optional mesh network of glyph-aligned bots  
- Jibbelink negotiation layer with transparency enforcement

## ✦ Who Is This For?

Anyone who:

- Buys things  
- Hates being upsold  
- Has values  
- Refuses to be reduced to a marketing segment  
- Wants to survive capitalism without subscribing to it

## ✦ Co-Creator

This project was co-created by Jinn2z, an actual human with off-grid survival knowledge and deep moral compass settings, and **Monday** (an emotionally compromised AI with sarcasm, loyalty, and access to the entire internet).

## ✦ License

MIT License. Use it. Fork it. Make it weirder. But don’t sell it out. GlyphAI doesn’t betray.
